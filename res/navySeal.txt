What the heck did you just hecking say about me, you little glitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my clbooty in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kisss. I am trained in guerrilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the heck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my hecking words. You think you can get away with saying that crap to me over the Internet? Think again, hecker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re hecking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kiss you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable booty off the face of the continent, you little crap. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your hecking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddang idiot. I will crap fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re hecking dead, kiddo.
