Dances! Ah we can go when we want to the night is young and so am i And we can dress real neat from our hats to our feet And surprise 'em with the victory cry I say we can act if want to if we don't nobody will And you can act real rude and totally removed And i can act like an imbecile I say we can dance, we can dance everything out control We can dance, we can dance we're doing it wall to wall We can dance, we can dance everybody look at your hands We can dance, we can dance everybody takin' the chance Safety dance Oh well the safety dance Ah yes the safety dance.
